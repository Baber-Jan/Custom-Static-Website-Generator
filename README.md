# Team Collaboration challenge - 1

This project will be either GPL or AGPL license which means itâ€™s an open source project that means the source code and application can be distributed for free.

## Create a whatsapp bot that creates a static webpage for you :
Your task is to ensure that a user can create a website from whatsapp. We will make all websites static to ensure that we can add future features such as deploying the websites to a server or IPFS. We will use a static website generator called hugo. 

Each team interested must have a minimum of 5 developers 

### Bot Developer :

### Deployment dev : 
When the backend dev calls deploy must run the following bash script. 

if it's a new repo
```bash
#!/bin/sh
reponame="$1"
if [ "$reponame" = "" ]; then
read -p "Enter Github Repository Name: " reponame
fi
mkdir ./$reponame
cd $reponame
curl -u USERNAME https://api.github.com/user/repos -d "{\"name\":\"$reponame\"}"
git init

then
    echo "The working directory is dirty. Please commit any pending changes."
    exit 1;
fi

echo "Deleting old publication"
rm -rf public
mkdir public
git worktree prune
